# Hello! I Yafeng Zhao | Steve 👋
I am [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University]（ https://www.polyu.edu.hk/tc/ ）[Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering]（ https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eee/ ）The Doctor. My research interests focus on the intersection of **power system stability and control**and **artificial intelligence**, and I am committed to using machine learning methods to improve the safety and economy of power grid operation.

## Research Interests

- **Optimized dispatching of power system**：Real time economic dispatch method based on deep reinforcement learning
- **Renewable energy grid integration**：Uncertainty modeling and optimization of high proportion renewable energy power systems
- **Machine learning in physical information**：Embedding physical constraints of power systems into neural networks
